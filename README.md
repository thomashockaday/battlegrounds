## User guide

### Controls

Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move.
Use the mouse to rotate the player's turret and aim.

### Notes

If using a track/touchpad, it's likely you will be unable to move and rotate at the same time.
This is an intentional feature in most operating systems.
You should be able to disable this in your system settings.
